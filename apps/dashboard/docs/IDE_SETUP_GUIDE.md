# 🔧 IDE Setup Guide - Fixing Import Errors

## 🎯 The Problem
After setting up absolute imports, your IDE might still show red underlines and errors for the `@/` imports, even though the build works correctly.

## ✅ Solutions

### 1. **Restart Your IDE** (Most Important!)
- **VS Code**: Close and reopen VS Code completely
- **WebStorm**: Restart the IDE
- **Other IDEs**: Restart the application

### 2. **Reload TypeScript Server** (VS Code)
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
- Press Enter

### 3. **Check Configuration Files**
Make sure these files are in the **root** of your project (not in a `config/` folder):
- ✅ `tsconfig.json`
- ✅ `tsconfig.app.json` 
- ✅ `tsconfig.node.json`
- ✅ `vite.config.ts`

### 4. **VS Code Settings** (Already Created)
I've created `.vscode/settings.json` with optimal settings for your project.

## 🔍 Verification Steps

### 1. **Check Build Works**
```bash
npm run build
```
✅ Should complete successfully

### 2. **Check TypeScript Compilation**
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
```
✅ Should show no errors

### 3. **Check IDE Recognition**
- Hover over an `@/` import
- Should show the correct file path
- Should have autocomplete suggestions

## 🚨 If Still Having Issues

### Option 1: Clear IDE Cache
**VS Code:**
1. Close VS Code
2. Delete `.vscode` folder (if exists)
3. Reopen VS Code
4. Open the project folder

### Option 2: Check File Locations
Make sure all config files are in the project root:
```
apps/procurement/
├── tsconfig.json          ✅
├── tsconfig.app.json      ✅  
├── vite.config.ts         ✅
├── package.json           ✅
└── src/                   ✅
```

### Option 3: Manual IDE Restart
1. Close your IDE completely
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Reopen the project
4. Wait for TypeScript to initialize

## 🎉 Expected Result

After following these steps, your imports should work perfectly:
- ✅ No red underlines
- ✅ Autocomplete works
- ✅ Go-to-definition works
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ TypeScript recognizes all paths

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If you're still seeing errors after following all steps:
1. Check that all config files are in the project root
2. Restart your IDE completely
3. Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify TypeScript works
4. Check that the build succeeds with `npm run build`

The absolute imports are working correctly - it's just an IDE recognition issue that should resolve with a restart!
