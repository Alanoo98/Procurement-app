## Agent Coordination

### Sequential Activation
When multiple agents are needed for a complex task:

1. **Planning Phase**: Activate relevant agents to understand requirements
2. **Design Phase**: Use agents to design the solution
3. **Implementation Phase**: Implement with appropriate agents
4. **Testing Phase**: Test with testing agent
5. **Documentation Phase**: Document with docs agent

### Parallel Activation
For tasks that can be worked on simultaneously:

```
Activate Frontend Agent and API Agent: Work together to implement a new supplier management feature
```

## Current Project Context

The procurement system is a multi-tenant application with:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Supabase backend with PostgreSQL
- Organization-based access control
- Role-based permissions
- Real-time features
- Invitation system

## Recent Agent Usage
- **Database Agent**: Enhanced authentication system with organization management
- **Frontend Agent**: Created authentication components and organization switcher
- **Auth Agent**: Implemented role-based access control and invitation system
- **API Agent**: Created invitation management APIs
- **Testing Agent**: Set up testing framework
- **Docs Agent**: Created comprehensive documentation

## Best Practices

### Agent Selection
- Choose the most relevant agent for your task
- Consider multi-agent collaboration for complex tasks
- Use agents for their specific expertise areas
- Don't hesitate to switch agents if needed

### Task Communication
- Be specific about your requirements
- Provide context about the current system
- Mention any constraints or preferences
- Ask for clarification if needed

### Agent Collaboration
- Plan multi-agent tasks carefully
- Ensure agents have necessary context
- Coordinate between agents effectively
- Maintain consistency across agent work
