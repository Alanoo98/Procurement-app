## Tools and Commands

### Supabase CLI
```bash
# Initialize project
supabase init

# Start local development
supabase start

# Deploy to production
supabase db push

# Deploy edge functions
supabase functions deploy

# Generate types
supabase gen types typescript --local > types/supabase.ts
```

### Vite Build
```bash
# Development build
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

### Environment Management
```bash
# Set environment variables
export VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_url
export VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_key

# Load from .env file
source .env
```

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# Push to remote
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Create pull request
gh pr create --title "Add new feature" --body "Description"
```
