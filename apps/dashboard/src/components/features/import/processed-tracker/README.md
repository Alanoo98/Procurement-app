# ProcessedTrackerManager Refactoring

This folder contains the refactored `ProcessedTrackerManager` component that was previously a single 986-line file. The component has been broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces for better maintainability and reusability.

## Component Breakdown

### Main Component (`ProcessedTrackerManager.tsx`)
- **Size**: ~100 lines (down from 986)
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates all sub-components and manages the overall state
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Imports and renders all sub-components
  - Handles high-level state management
  - Provides callback functions to child components

### Custom Hook (`useProcessedTracker.ts`)
- **Size**: ~400 lines
- **Purpose**: Contains all the business logic and data fetching
- **Responsibilities**:
  - API calls to Supabase
  - State management for documents, filters, pagination
  - Document processing operations (import, send to Nanonets, etc.)
  - Sorting and filtering logic

### UI Components (50-150 lines each)
Each component has a single responsibility:

1. **ProcessedTrackerHeader**: Title, description, and refresh button
2. **ProcessedTrackerControls**: Accounting year input and location selection
3. **ProcessedTrackerFilters**: Status and location filter dropdowns
4. **ProcessedTrackerActions**: Import/Send buttons and bulk actions menu
5. **ProcessedTrackerTable**: Data table with sorting and individual actions
6. **ProcessedTrackerPagination**: Page navigation controls
7. **DeleteConfirmationModal**: Confirmation dialog for deletions

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to unit test
4. **Readability**: Code is easier to understand and navigate
5. **Performance**: Components can be optimized individually
6. **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different components simultaneously

## Usage

The component is used exactly the same way as before:

```tsx
import { ProcessedTrackerManager } from '../components/import/ProcessedTrackerManager';

// In your JSX
<ProcessedTrackerManager />
```

## Migration Notes

- All existing functionality has been preserved
- The component API remains the same
- No breaking changes for consumers
- The original file now exports from the new location for backward compatibility

## Future Improvements

- Add unit tests for individual components
- Consider extracting common table patterns into reusable components
- Add error boundaries for better error handling
- Implement virtual scrolling for large datasets
- Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions
